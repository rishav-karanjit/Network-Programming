# Network-Programming-Lab

### Before You Start:
<ul>
  <li> All the programs under each parts is given below.ðŸ”»
  <li> Naming Convention for each of the program folder is [PartName][ProgramName]. For eg: A1 is 1st program of part A</li>
  <li> Part 2 programs requires some installations:
    <ol>
        <li>NS2: sudo apt-get install ns2 -y</li>
        <li>NAM: sudo apt-get install nam  -y</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

#### PART A
<ol>
  <li>For the given network graph, write a program to implement Link state routing algorithm to build a routing table for the given node</li>
  <li>Write a program to divide the message into variable length frames and sort them and display the message at the receiving side.</li>
  <li>Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client â€“ server program, the client sends the file name and the server sends back the requested text file if present.</li>
  <li>Implement the above program using FIFOs as IPC channels</li>
  <li>Using UDP, write a client â€“ server program, to exchange messages between client and the server.</li>
  <li>Write a socket program to demonstrate IP multicasting which provides the capability for an application to send a single IP datagram that a group of hosts in a network can receive.</li>
  <li>Write a program to implement sliding window protocol between two hosts.</li>
  <li>Write a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16- bits).</li>
</ol>

#### PART B
<ol>
  <li>Simulate a three nodes point â€“ to â€“ point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size and vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.</li>
  <li>Simulate a four node point-to-point network with the link connectedasfollows:n0 â€“ n2, n1â€“ n2 and n2 â€“ n3. Apply TCP agent between n0-n3 and UDP between n1-n3. Apply relevant applications over TCP and UDP agents changing the parameter and determine the number of packets sent by TCP / UDP.</li>
  <li>Simulate the different types of Internet traffic such as FTP and TELNET over a network and analyze the throughput.</li>
  <li>Simulate an Ethernet LAN using n nodes (6-10), change error rate and data rate and compare the throughput.</li>
  <li>Simulate an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and determine the collision across different nodes.</li>
  <li>Simulate the transmission of ping messages over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.</li>
  <li>Simulate simple ESS with transmitting nodes in wire-less LAN and determine the performance with respect to transmission of packets.</li>
  <li>Simulate simple ad-hoc network with transmitting nodes and determine the performance with respect to transmission of packets</li>
</ol>
